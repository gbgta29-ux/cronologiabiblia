# **App Name**: Biblical Chronicles

## Core Features:

- Module Display: Display a grid of modules representing books of the Bible in chronological order.
- PDF Viewer Integration: Open and display PDF documents within the app for each module.
- Bottom Navigation: Implement a fixed bottom navigation bar with icons for Home, Library, Search, and Profile.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Very dark gray (#121212) to provide a dark, cinematic ambiance.
- Primary color: Gold/amber (#FFB300), to reflect fire and ancient parchment, suggestive of divinity. Note: not pure gold, which would be a cliche.
- Accent color: Pale gold (#FFF5E1). Lighter variant of the primary, providing visual lift against the dark background.
- Titles: 'Literata' serif, for an elegant, literary, vintage feel, suitable for biblical themes.
- Body: 'Inter' sans-serif, white or very light gray for clean contrast against the dark background.
- Minimalist white outline icons for bottom navigation, in iOS style.
- Square/slightly rounded cards arranged in a 3-column grid with small margins between cards for a clean, symmetrical composition.
- Module card design includes a thematic biblical image in an epic, realistic painting style, with golden/fiery/ancient tones.
